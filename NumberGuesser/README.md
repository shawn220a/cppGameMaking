# Program: Number Guesser

## Steps to program game

- [ ] Create a program called number guesser.
- [ ] There will be a secret number that is set at the start of the program without any user input.
- [ ] The secret number should be picked from a certain range.
- [ ] The range of the nubmer should be output to the player.
- [ ] The player should be prompted to enter his guess.
- [ ] The prompt should show how many guesses the player has left.
- [ ] The player will then enter his guess.
- [ ] If the guess is too high then the game will output that the guess was to high.
- [ ] If the guess is too low then the game will output that the guess was to low.
- [ ] The player only has a certain number of guesses.
- [ ] The number of guesses should be based on the range of the secret number.
- [ ] Any wrong guess will decrement the number of guesses left.
- [ ] The game ends by saying what the secret number was regardless of if the player guessed the right number.
- [ ] When the game is over, the player should be prompted if he would like to play again.
- [ ] If yes then the secret number should change.
- [ ] Any input errors by the player should have proper handling.
